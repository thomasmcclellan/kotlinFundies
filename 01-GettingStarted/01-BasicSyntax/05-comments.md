# Basic Syntax - Comments
Just like most modern languages, `Kotlin` supports single-line (or _end-of-line_) and multi-line (or _block_) comments.

```kotlin
// This is an end-of-line comment

/*
This is a block comment
of multiple lines
*/
```

Block comments in `Kotlin` can be nested.

```kotlin
/*
The comment starts here
  /*
  contains a nested comment
  */
and ends here
*/
```
